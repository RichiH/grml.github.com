        <h2>We want you!</h2>

        <p><a href="http://grml.org/">Grml</a> is an active <em>open source
          project</em>, available since 2003 and serving <em>tens of thousands
          of users</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>We need your help!</strong> Driven by a <a
        href="http://grml.org/team/">small team</a> in their free time we can't
        get as much stuff done as we'd like to. If Grml saved your ass and want
        to give something back to the Grml project this website will get you
        started.</p>

        <span class="label important">Disclaimer</span> Don't be afraid of us.
        You might think that you are not experienced enough to contribute to
        Grml (or any other open source project). But let us tell your otherwise:
        by using Grml and hitting this page you've pretty good chances to
        already provide a decent baseline matching our needs. No matter how
        small your contribution might look to you, it really matters for us!
        Don't be shy, let's make Grml a kick ass solution!


        <h2>How to contribute to Grml.org</h2>

        <p>Grml joined the Github party, all our repositories are available at
        <a href="http://github.com/grml/">github.com/grml</a>. If you already
        have a Github account it's rocking simple to contribute.

        <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span>: while it brings benefit to
        both sides of the party there really is no need to have an Github
        account. We even run a copy of all the Github stuff on our <a
        href="http://git.grml.org/">own infrastructure</a>. But social coding
        rocks!</p>

        <p>So, how to get started?</p>

        <ul>

         <li>You already have a patch? Go straight towards <a href="#upstream">get your work upstream</a></li>

         <li>You already have a repository and want to create a patch out of it?
         Checkout <a href="#patch">how to create a patch</a></li>

         <li>Already know which repository to work with? Skip over to <a href="#fork">Fork!</a></li>

         <li>Not sure where to find the according sources? Just <a
         href="#identify">read on...</a></li>

        </ul>


        <a name="identify"></a><br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Identifying the appropriate Git repository</h2>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/grml">Soooo many Git repositories</a>,
        you might ask where to start? We are here to serve you!</p>

        <p>Grml's project homepage is available as <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml.org">git repository</a>. If you
        found a typo, feel the desparate need to fix our <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch">denglish</a> or work on
        our documentation that's the right place to start.</p>

        <p>If you are also a huge fan of Zsh, Vim, Screen and Tmux and want to
        pimp their configs the <a
          href="git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git">grml-etc-core</a>
        repository is where the music plays.</p>

        <p>You're already enjoying your own Live system based on Grml?
        Fantastic! Don't forget to check out <a
          href="http://github.com/grml/grml-live">grml-live</a>.</p>

        <p>Now let's visit the machine room. The boot process of Grml starts
        with the Linux kernel, which includes patches and configuration found in
        <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-kernel">the grml-kernel
          repository</a>.  The initramfs takes over, driven by <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/live-boot-grml">live-boot-grml</a>.
        Once the initramfs stage was finished the main bootup process featured
        by <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-autoconfig">grml-autoconfig</a>
        takes over. live-boot-grml and grml-autoconfig are also the place where
        all the nifty Grml <a href="http://grml.org/cheatcodes/">boot
          options</a> are implemented at.</p>

        <p>A simple frontend to set up booting via network (PXE) is known as <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml-terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>.</p>

        <p>To get your Live system onto a USB pen <a
          href="https://github.com/grml/grml2usb">grml2usb</a> is waiting for
        you.</p>

        <p><span class="label notice">Notice</span>: none of the described
        repositories matches your needs? Either figure out <a
          href="https://github.com/grml">the repository</a> and try to spot the
        appropriate repository or just <a href="#contact">talk to us</a>.</p>


        <a name="fork"></a><br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Fork!</h2>

        <p>You <a href="#identify">identified the according Git repository</a>?
        Great! The easiest way to play with the repository is by choosing the
        'Fork' feature at the right side of the upper screen:</p>

        <ul class="media-grid">
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core">
              <img class="thumbnail" src="img/fork.png" alt="Screenshot of Fork button at Github" />
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should give you your own copy of the Git repository and you can
        commit to it without even asking us for permission. Then you can simply
        <a href="#patch">create a patch</a>.

        <p>If you don't have a Github account (yet?) then you can grab the Git
        repository anyway. On the Github web page you can click on the 'Git
        Read-Only' option. Then check out the URL (being
        'git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git' in the following
        screenshot):</p>

        <ul class="media-grid">
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core">
              <img class="thumbnail" src="img/clone.png" alt="Screenshot of Github repository cloning" />
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Check out the repository and explore it:</p>

<pre>
% git clone git://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core.git
% cd grml-etc-core</pre>


        <a name="patch"></a><br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Create a patch</h2>

        <p>Creating a patch is simple. Check out a new branch in your repository
        (to avoid messing and conflicts possibly showing up in master):</p>

        <pre>
% git checkout -b mygreatfeature</pre>

        <p>Implement your bugfix/feature and if you're happy about it commit
        your work (replace $FILES with the files you changed):</p>

% [hack hack hack]
% git add $FILES
% git commit -v</pre>

        <p>That's it pretty much. If you aren't familiar with Git yet and want
        to learn more <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a> has plenty
        of useful information.</p>

        <p>Finally it would be great to share your work with us!</p>


        <a name="upstream"></a><br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Get your work upstream</h2>

        <p>Getting your work into Grml isn't just about making Grml even hotter.
        It also has advantages for you! You get your features tested and
        maintained by a community, gain credits and get immediate builds of it
        served by our <a href="http://jenkins.grml.org/">awesome continuous
          integration lab</a>. Alright!</p>

        <p>If you chose to <a href="#fork">forked</a> the repository all you've
        to do is click on the 'Pull Request' button on your Github page:</p>

        <div class="span4">
          <ul class="media-grid">
            <li>
              <a href="http://grml.org/screenshots/">
                <img src="img/pull-request.png" alt="Screenshot of Github's pull-request button" />
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you're interested in further documentation regarding the pull

        <p>Then send the created patch file(s) to bugs (at) grml.org. Either use
        your common mail client or if you prefer to use Git itself invoke:</p>

<pre>
% git send-email 000*</pre>

        <span class="label important">Important</span> If you're unsure about
